# House Price Prediction  

This is my second project for the Cloudcredits Technologies internship.  
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset and a Linear Regression model.  

---

## Overview  
The project focuses on building a simple machine learning regression model to understand how different factors like the number of rooms, property location, and crime rate affect house prices.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling and analysis  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations  
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model  

---

## What I Did  
1. Loaded the Boston Housing dataset  
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships  
3. Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets  
4. Trained a Linear Regression model  
5. Evaluated the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² Score**  
6. Plotted a graph comparing **Actual vs Predicted** house prices  

---

## Results  
- The model provided a good baseline for predicting house prices  
- Visualizations helped in identifying strong correlations between features and prices
