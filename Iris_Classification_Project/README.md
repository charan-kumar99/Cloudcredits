# Iris Flower Classification  

This is my first project as part of my Cloudcredits Technologies internship.  
The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their petal and sepal measurements.  

---

## Overview  
I started this project to get practical experience with machine learning.  
I used a Decision Tree Classifier because it is simple to implement and works well with this dataset.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy for handling and analyzing data  
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for creating visualizations  
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the machine learning model  

---

## What I Did  
1. Loaded and explored the Iris dataset  
2. Performed basic data analysis and created visualizations  
3. Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training and 20% testing)  
4. Trained a Decision Tree model on the training data  
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
6. Visualized the decision tree to better understand how predictions are made  

---

## Results  
- The model achieved an accuracy of about 96%  
- Visualizations showed clear separation between species  
- The confusion matrix confirmed that most predictions were accurate
